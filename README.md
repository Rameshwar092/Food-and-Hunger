## Overall Learning 
The Food and Hunger project is a socially impactful web-based platform that uses modern technologies to connect food donors with orphanages and NGOs who cannot afford food. By building the system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Spring Boot, and Java, the platform offers a complete solution for food donation, request management, volunteer support, and real-time communication. The project not only reduces food wastage but also ensures that needy communities receive essential meals on time, making it a vital tool for social good and community welfare.

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: <!-- Add Project Title --></h3>
<p>
  The Food and Hunger Management System is a full-stack web application designed to reduce food wastage and support people in need—especially poor communities, orphanages, and NGOs that struggle to access sufficient food. The project connects donors (restaurants, households, hotels, and supermarkets) with receivers (orphanages, NGOs, shelters) through a simple and efficient digital platform.

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Spring Boot, and Java, the system ensures smooth interaction between the frontend and backend, providing a reliable solution for real-time food donation and distribution.
